Description
===========

This is the P600FW project, a CPU/firmware remake for the SCI Prophet 600.
It uses a slightly modified Teensy++ board (http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp_pins.html) that plugs into the Z80 socket.

Modifying the Teensy++
======================

Usage
=====

Changes from the base Prophet 600 firmware:

	1) Lasting changes

- "Mixer" changes Oscillator A level.
- "Glide" changes Oscillator B level.
- "Poly-mod fil env", "Filter envelope amount" and "Oscillator B fine" zero position is now half-course (allows negative envelopes and flat detune).

	2) Alpha version changes

- "Speed" changes glide level.
- "1" changes LFO shapes (Pulse-Triangle*/Random-Sine).
- "2" changes LFO speed (Slow*/Medium/Fast).
- "3" changes ModWheel strength (Full*/Half/Minimum).
- "4" changes Amplifier envelope shape and speed (Fast linear/Fast exponential*/Slow linear/Slow exponential).
- "5" changes Filter envelope shape and speed (Fast linear/Fast exponential*/Slow linear/Slow exponential).
- "6" changes Pitch input mode (Chromatic/Free*).
- "7" changes Pitch bend range (Third/Fifth*/Octave).
- "8" changes Pitch bend target (Pitch*/Filter/Volume/Off).
- "9" sets current Pitch bend position as neutral point (calibration).
- "0" changes assigner mono mode and note priority (Unison low*/Unison high/Mono low/Mono high).

* means default value.

/!\ Pitch bend must be calibrated using the "9" key in order to get correct oscillator pitch /!\
